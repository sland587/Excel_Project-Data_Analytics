### Data Validation

#### Filtered List

- **Enhanced Data Validation:** Implementing the filtered list as a data validation rule under the `Job Title`, `Country`, and `Type` option in the Data tab ensures:
    - User input is restricted to predefined, validated schedule types
    - Incorrect or inconsistent entries are prevented
    - Overall usability of the dashboard is enhanced
